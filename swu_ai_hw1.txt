// Initial state is that robot is at location a; location a and b, location b and c are directly connected respectively. 
// Note that location a and c are not directly connected. 
Initial state: At(Robot,a), Conn(a,b), Conn(b,c)

// Goal state is that robot has moved to c. 
Goal state: At(Robot,c)

// Defined actions. 
Actions:
	// Action: the robot moving from location X to Y. 
	Move(X,Y)
	// The preconditions are that the robot is located at X, and location X and Y are directly connected. 
	Preconditions: At(Robot,X), Conn(X,Y)
	// The postcondition is that robot is located at Y, while other conditions are unchanged. 
	Postconditions: !At(Robot,X), At(Robot,Y)
